## üóÇÔ∏è CSV File Format

### File Structure

The CSV file should contain the following columns (in order):

| Column | Required | Type | Description | Example |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `day` | ‚úÖ Yes | Integer | Day number (1-based) | `1` |

## üìπ Video URLs

### Supported Formats

- **YouTube**: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`

## üöÄ Import Process

### Step 1: Prepare CSV File

1. Create a CSV file with the required columns
2. Add metadata at the top (optional)
3. Fill in workout schedule day by day
4. Save the file (e.g., `my-program.csv`)

### Step 2: Import in App

1. Open Beast App
2. Go to **Programs** tab
3. Tap the **"Import Program"** button (‚¨ÜÔ∏è icon)
4. Select your CSV file
5. Review the import preview
6. Confirm import

### Step 3: Verify Import

1. The new program will appear in your Programs list
2. You can set it as your active program
3. All workout days will be available in the Calendar

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Validation Rules

- **Day numbers** must be sequential (1, 2, 3, ...)
- **Title** is required for each day
- **Duration** must be a positive integer (in minutes)
- **Rest day** flag overrides exercises (rest days won't log exercises)
- Duplicate day numbers will cause import to fail

### Exercise Handling

- If an exercise ID is not found, it will be skipped
- You can import programs without exercises (manual entry during workout)
- New exercises can be added to the database separately

### File Size Limits

- Maximum program duration: **365 days**
- Maximum file size: **5 MB**
- Maximum exercises per workout: **20**

---

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Test with small programs first** - Start with a 7-day program to verify format
2. **Use consistent naming** - Keep workout titles consistent for better tracking
3. **Include descriptions** - Help users understand workout focus
4. **Add video links** - Enhance user experience with demonstration videos
5. **Mark rest days clearly** - Use the `rest_day` flag for proper calendar display
